# Obstacle-avoider
In robotics, obstacle avoidance is the task of satisfying some control objective subject to non-intersection or non-collision position constraints. In unmanned air vehicles, it is a hot topic. What is critical about obstacle avoidance concept in this area is the growing need of usage of unmanned aerial vehicles in urban areas for especially military applications where it can be very useful in city wars.

Normally obstacle avoidance is considered to be distinct from path planning in that one is usually implemented as a reactive control law while the other involves the pre-computation of an obstacle-free path which a controller will then guide a robot along. With recent advanced in the autonomous vehicles sector, a good and dependable obstacle avoidance feature of a driverless platform is also required to have a robust obstacle detection module.
